# Project Scaffold

## Overview

Project Scaffold is ~~automated~~ project-structure generator tailored by HTEC Group standards.

## Features

- Standardized Editor's configuration (.editorconfig)
- SourceCode and InfrastructureAsCode templates
- Skaffold manifest for local kubernetes development (skaffold.yaml)
- Incorporated Dockerfile best practices (multistage, distroless, rootless)
- Incorporated pre-commit git hooks  
- Optimized .gitignore

## Usage

Copy/Paste is the only option at the moment. We plan to develop CLI tool that can create new 
or update existing project structure.
